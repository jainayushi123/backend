This is the complete backend project.
type inside package is module instead of commonjs
type nul > index.js; type nul > app.js; type nul > constants.js (this is used to craete the files in terminal)

foreach ($dir in "controllers","db","middlewares","routes","services","models","utils") {
mkdir $dir
}
I am using this loop statement for making multiple folders together
